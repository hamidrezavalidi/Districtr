                 <p align= "justify">
                      Every ten years, the United States government attempts to count every person living in the country, something known as the Census.
                      After the Census, states are required to redraw the districts of their state and federal legislatures in order to account
                      for the change in population and movement of people across the country. Although all states are redraw districts after 
                      the Census, the rules for redistricting vary greatly from state to state.
                      This article asks users to interact with <a href="https://districtr.org/">Districtr</a> and <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/CGR%20Reprint%20Single%20Page.pdf">A Citizen's Guide To Redistricting</a>

                <h2 class="place__subheading">Population Balance</h2>
                    <p align= "justify">
                        Population balance is one of the few rules of redistricting that is clear-cut and followed by every state.
                        In a series of cases known as the “one person, one vote” cases, the Supreme Court ruled that each district’s
                        population must be about equal.
                    </p>
                    <p align= "justify">
                       A balanced population has a different meaning depending on the state. Thus, population deviation is an important
                      part of ensuring that each district adheres to the state's respective definition. 
                    </p>
                    <p align= "justify">
                        Here are some basic definitions for calculating population deviations.
                    </p>
                    <p align= "justify">
                            <strong>Ideal (average) population</strong> is the average population of districts in a state.
                    </p>
                    <p align= "justify">
                            <strong>Deviation</strong> is the percentage by which population differs from the mean.  

                    </p>
                    <p align= "justify">
                        <strong>Average deviation</strong> is the average of deviations of districts (i.e., ∑districts deviations/ total number of districts).
                    </p>
                    <p align= "justify">
                        <strong>Total deviation</strong> is the difference between the maximum and minimum deviations (i.e., total deviation = maximum deviation - minimum deviation). 
                    </p>

                <p align = "justify">
                Many states have constitutional requirements that all districts must be compact in some way. However, compactness is not clearly defined when it comes
                to redistricting. Thus, the law is open to a wide variety of interpretations.
                </p>
                
                <p align = "justify">
                The “eye-ball test” has become a convention many people use to determine compactness: if a district looks compact, then it is compact.
                </p>
                
                <p align = "justify">
                The most compact shape is a circle. Districts are difficult to draw as circles due to the geography of most states. As such, people have developed various
                ways to quantify compactness such as the Polsby-Popper score or dispersion-based measures. For more information, consult with <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/CGR%20Reprint%20Single%20Page.pdf">A Citizen's Guide To Redistricting</a>.

                <p align = "justify">
                Cut edges is another measure of compactness that considers number of edges between different districts. The fewer number of cut edges in a districting plan,
                the more compact it is. The following districting plans contain blue and beige districts where each district has 9 nodes but the plans have a different number of cut edges.

                    <b>Packing</b> is cramming people with  the same partisan interest into one district to dilute their voting strength. If all of one party or demographic is<b>packed</b>
                    into one district, then it weakens their voting power in other parts of the state.

                    <b>Cracking</b> is dividing a group of people with same partisan interest into different districts. This decreases the voting strength of the group to win a district. <b>
                    Cracking</b> is normally implemented by splitting relatively homogenous communities.
