    This module was created in response to the current lawsuit (Huot et al. v.
    City of Lowell et al.) challenging the City of Lowell's at-large electoral
    system for City Council and School Committee. Plaintiffs in the case argue
    that the current system dilutes the votes of Lowell's communities of color.
