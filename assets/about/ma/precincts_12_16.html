    The units you see here are <strong>precincts</strong> from the 2010
    redistricting cycle. The 2012-2016 raw, unprocessed precinct shapefile comes
    from the office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,
    William Francis Galvin. All election data comes from the Secretary of the
    Commonwealth's
    <a href="http://electionstats.state.ma.us">Elections Division website</a>.
    The source shapefile for this module, along with additional information
    about processing, is available for download from MGGG's GitHub organization

    This module was created to aid in a paper,
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09051"
        >"Locating the representational baseline: Republicans in
        Massachusetts,"</a
    >
    written by MGGG and collaborators. Despite Republicans usually gaining
    between 30% and 40% of the two-way vote share in statewide elections,
    Massachusetts has not elected a Republican to the US House of
    Representatives since 1994. The paper finds that the underperformance of
    Republicans in Massachusetts is not the result of gerrymandering or
    candidate availability, but rather is a factor of the spatial distribution
    of Republican voters in the state.
