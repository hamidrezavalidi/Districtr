    obtained from the Massachusetts Elections Division website and the
    Massachusetts Bureau of Geographic Information (MassGIS). The town shapefile
    was downloaded from the

    This module was created to aid in a paper,
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09051"
        >"Locating the representational baseline: Republicans in
        Massachusetts,"</a
    >
    written by MGGG and collaborators. Despite Republicans usually gaining
    between 30% and 40% of the two-way vote share in statewide elections,
    Massachusetts has not elected a Republican to the US House of
    Representatives since 1994. The paper finds that the underperformance of
    Republicans in Massachusetts is not the result of gerrymandering or
    candidate availability, but rather is a factor of the spatial distribution
    of Republican voters in the state.
