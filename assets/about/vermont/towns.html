    The units you see here are <strong>towns</strong>. Data for this module were
    obtained from the Vermont Open Geodata Portal, the Vermont Secretary of
    State, and the US Census Bureau. The town shapefile was downloaded from the
    <a href="http://geodata.vermont.gov/datasets/vt-data-town-boundaries"
        >Vermont Open Geodata Portal</a
    >
    and election results were downloaded from
    <a href="https://www.sec.state.vt.us/elections/election-results.aspx"
        >the Secretary of State's website</a
    >. Vermont does not release election results for towns with a total
    population under 50, thus 9 towns have been excluded from this module.
    Demographic information from the 2010 Decennial Census was downloaded at the
    sub-county level from
    <a href="https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml"
        >American FactFinder</a
    >. The source shapefile for this module, along with additional information
    about processing, is available for download from MGGG's GitHub organization
    <a href="https://github.com/mggg-states/VT-shapefiles">@mggg-states</a>.
