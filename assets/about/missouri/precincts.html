    The units used here are <strong>voting tabulation districts</strong> or
    VTDs. Data for this module were obtained from the
    <a
        href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=hdl:1902.1/16795"
        >Harvard Election Data Archive</a
    >. The source shapefile for this module, along with additional information
    about processing, is available for download from MGGG's GitHub organization

    This shapefile and corresponding election data are from the 2008 election
    cycle. In November 2018, Missouri passed a constitutional amendment that
    makes the state demographer responsible for drawing the state's legislative
    districts, rather than the state legislature itself. MGGG is currently
    working to compile a more recent precinct shapefile with election results,
    but Missouri is a notoriously difficult state to do this because of
    discrepancies between election results reported by counties and the census
    provided VTDs.
