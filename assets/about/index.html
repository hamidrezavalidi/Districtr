                This module was created because of a lawsuit against Santa
                Clara's at-large electoral system for City Council, which
                plaintiffs claim posed a structural impediment to the election
                of Asian Americans. A district court in May 2018 ruled that the
                voting system violated the California Voting Rights Act (for

                The units you see here are wards, which are Wisconsin's precinct

            <p>
                The units used here are voting tabulation districts or VTDs.
                Data for this module were obtained from the

            <p>
                This shapefile and corresponding election data are from the 2008
                election cycle. In November 2018, Missouri passed a
                constitutional amendment that makes the state demographer
                responsible for drawing the state's legislative districts,
                rather than the state legislature itself. MGGG is currently
                working to compile a more recent precinct shapefile with
                election results, but Missouri is a notoriously difficult state
                to do this because of discrepancies between election results
                reported by counties and the census provided VTDs.

                In March 2019 the US Supreme Court heard oral arguments for
                Rucho v. Common Cause, in which plaintiffs claim that North
                Carolina's remedial 2016 congressional map is an
                unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. The 2016 remedial map had
                been drawn after the Supreme Court struck down two of the
                state's 2011 enacted congressional districts as unconstitutional
                racial gerrymanders. MGGG and our collaborators filed an amicus

                rather is a factor of the spatial distribution of Republican
