    The units you see here are <strong>census blocks</strong>. Data for this
    module were obtained from the US Census Bureau. The block shapefile for the

    <a href="https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html"
        >TIGER/Line Shapefiles</a

    the block level from
    <a href="https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml"
        >American FactFinder</a
    >. The source shapefile with demographic information is available for
