    The units used here are <strong>voting tabulation districts</strong>, or
    VTDs. The raw, unprocessed VTDs were collected from the Census
    <a href="https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html"
        >TIGER/Line Shapefiles</a
    >. Election data was compiled at the precinct level by a private individual
    and was found to be within 1% of the official state-reported results at the
    county and state levels. Demographic information from the 2010 Decennial
    Census was downloaded at the block level from
    <a href="https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml"
        >American FactFinder</a
    >. The source shapefile for this module, along with additional information
    about processing, is available for download from MGGG's GitHub organization
    <a href="https://github.com/mggg-states/PA-shapefiles">@mggg-states</a>.

    In February 2018, Moon Duchin was asked by Governor Tom Wolf to provide
    guidance in evaluating redistricting plans for fairness after the
    Pennsylvania Supreme Court struck down the 2011 enacted plan as an
    unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. Her report is hosted on
    <a href="https://mggg.org/uploads/md-report.pdf">MGGG's website</a>.
